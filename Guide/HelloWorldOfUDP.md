We plan to learn by playing Warcraft, so to do that, we will have to use code that is too high level for you :(  
But don't worry; you will quickly be able to read them or code them.  

So, in the waiting of having the level, we will try to use them.  

But we start with the base of the base of coding.   
I will teach you one thing:  
"Send text message to an application."   


Why?   
Because if you can do that, then you can do anything.  
As I will provide you hundreds of small toolboxes that receive messages and do stuff for you :)  

So let's start.  


## C# vs Python vs LUA  

To learn to code, you have hundreds of languages to speak with the machines.  
But we want to learn:   
- how to simulate key in a quick script: Python  
- how to make a small application that runs on a phone: C# in Unity3D  
- how to make a small console application that does window code: C# in console  
- how to use the most-used script in QA testing, LUA, to be able to mod our app. 

So, where do we start!?  
By learning Python.  

We will keep it easy and switch to C#, then LUA later in other guides.
