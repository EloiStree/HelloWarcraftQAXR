Hey hey.  
Nice, you want to follow a guide on how to code :)  
Perfect.  

We plan to learn by playing at Warcraft so to do that we will have to use code that are to high level for you :(  
But don't worry you quickly be able to read them or to code them.  

So in the waiting of having the leve we will try to use them.  

Be we start with the base of the base of coding.   
I will teach you to one stuffs:  
"Send text message to an application"   


Why?   
Because if you can do that then you can do anything.  
As I will provide you hundred of small toolboxes that receive message and do stuffs for you :)  

So let's start.  


## C# vs Python cs LUA  

To learn to code you have hundred of language to speak with the machines.  
But us we want to learn:   
- how to simulate key in quick script: Python  
- how to make small application that run on phone: C# in Unity3D  
- how to make small console application that do window code: C# in console  
- how to use the most used script in QA testing LUA to be able to mod our app. 

So where do we start !?  
By learning python.  

We will keep it easy and switch to C# then LUA later on other guides.
