- Create an account for europe and an account for the reste of the world.
- Go on battle net and create the two battle net accound
- Create two starter on asia, four starter on america, 5 starter on europe , 1 on russia (small exception here)

- For EU, America and Asia you need to create one account that you will bring level 10 then do the BFA introduction.
  - The level 10 limite is account wide but on EU, Asia or America zone.
  - You can skip the campaign start donjon of BFA if you did it once (memory per continant)
 
Two ways of seeing the problem. Level up 12 accounts to level 10 and move them to BFA or level 3 payed account to 70 and unlock a side faction.
Have a side faction unlock help as it create level 10 with mount directly. Making much easier for lot's of botting part.
But here we will go on the level 10 level up.


- To Skip the level 10 tutorial
  - Create a demoniste on each continant.
  - Create a macro that press 1 and then tab
    - or press 1 four time then tab
  - run the macro on the 3 guard to go level 2
  - at level two use "corruption" instead.
  - move back to be able to corrupt the 6 dummy
  - wait until level 10
    - overwatch the screen to avoid doing it when lot's of player are there
    - do it at afk time if possible
  - At level 10 on all the continant you can quite the game and relaunch all your accounts.
- You skip the tutorial, good, now let's create a character on all the sever.
  - Create a range character for each region as sever in region are linked. 
    - For EU you can just log on all the acount and create a character on each sever. Un account = a server
    - For America and Asia, you need to use battle net. The launcher need a specific launch.
    - For Russia, (don't know yet because you need your game to be setup for Russia) 
- You have now skip the tutorial, let's try to be level 10.
  - Find a place with easy mobs to kill that respond when you have kill them all (or quickly enough.)
    - For me it is in the elf shadow glen with the Grell
  -
