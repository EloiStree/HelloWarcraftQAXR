# Introduction

Welcome to you.

My name is Éloi Strée.
I am just a mad man having fun with XR and code.

The project here is to teach how to code in C# Python and LUA to work in the video game industry as QA tester for game and XR.

If those topic speak to you, I invite you to start the adventure with us.

But be aware, that not a one week tutorial.   
You know when you start, you don't know when you stop ;)
