# Introduction

Welcome.

My name is √âloi Str√©e.
I am just a madman having fun with XR and code.

The project here is to teach how to code in C#, Python, and LUA to work in the video game industry as a QA tester for games and XR.

If these topics speak to you, I invite you to start the adventure with us.

But be aware, it's not a one-week tutorial.   
You know when you start, you don't know when you stop ;)
