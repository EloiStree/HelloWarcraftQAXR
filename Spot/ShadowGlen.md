At Shadow Glen you have one of the best spot of leveling level 1-35.
Why ?

What are you looking for when you want to level up
- A place with not a lot's of player
  - Most new player are set up in the boat tutorial
- A place with easy monster to kill
  - You have the Grel and grellkin  that are easy to kill
  - They are neutral so they only attack when you attack them
- A place where player don't go
  - if you go to the 27.5 56.0 coordonate of the map you are not in quest zone and hiden by tree.
    - Very very low chance to have someone coming there. (non null but low)
    - If you are still affraid of beeing report (switch to PVP as soon as you champ can)
- A place where you don't need to run for hours or level up to use.
  - It is (as Elf) like 40 seconds away of the start zone. 
- Mainly, you want a place where the mob respawn as soon as the group of mob are all death.
  - With 5 good place account it is achievable and you can put 2 group of 4 of you need.
- The loot drop some rare time some bag.

Use `/target Grellkin` to select the enemy to attack.


## Time and speed
Big note: They are fast way to level up. What I am proposing here are slow way but with low risk of ban.  
If you use this spot, expect to level up from 1-15 in one full night. 15-20 in one full day and 1-30-35 in one or two day depending on how you manage your position and groups.  
A faster way to level up is the Boralus elite spot. But you risk all the time to fall on other bots that want to farm andd will report you (or players)._


## Position

Here the minimum is a group B position with 5 people farming the zone.
And if you want to have more that 4-5 characters. you can spread the other on the group A to kill the far aways mobs.


In the group B, the minimum covert zone are here:

You need to think about ways to covert behind and the side of the baraquement.   
But also to have enough power in the camp to avoid dying when you sleep.
