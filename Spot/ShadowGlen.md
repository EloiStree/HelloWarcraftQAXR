At Shadow Glen you have one of the best spot of leveling level 1-35.
Why ?

What are you looking for when you want to level up
- A place with not a lot's of player
  - Most new player are set up in the boat tutorial
- A place with easy monster to kill
  - You have the Grel and grellkin  that are easy to kill
  - They are neutral so they only attack when you attack them
- A place where player don't go
  - if you go to the 27.5 56.0 coordonate of the map you are not in quest zone and hiden by tree.
    - Very very low chance to have someone coming there. (non null but low)
    - If you are still affraid of beeing report (switch to PVP as soon as you champ can)
- A place where you don't need to run for hours or level up to use.
  - It is (as Elf) like 40 seconds away of the start zone. 
- Mainly, you want a place where the mob respawn as soon as the group of mob are all death.
  - With 5 good place account it is achievable and you can put 2 group of 4 of you need.
- The loot drop some rare time some bag.
